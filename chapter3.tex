\section{COLREGS}\label{sec:colregs}

The following rules (shortened and paraphrased) are relevant for the V2V encounter \citep{COLREGS}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rule 8: Action to avoid Collision}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[(a)] Any action to avoid collision shall, if circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time, and with due regard to good seamanship.
            \item[(b)] Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision, shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.
            \item[(c)] If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid
            a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in
            another close-quarters situation.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule 13: Overtaking }
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[(b)] Any vessel overtaking another vessel shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam.
            \item[(d)] Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule 14: Head-on situation}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[(a)] When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule 15: Crossing situation}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[] When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.
    
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule 16: Action by Give-way Vessel}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [] Every vessel which is directed to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rule 17: Action by Stand-on Vessel}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[(i)] Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.
            \item[(ii)] The latter vessel may take action to prevent collision if it is apparent that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimal Control Theory}
\subsection{Semi-infinite Programming}\label{sec:semi-infinite-programming}

Semi-infinite programming is a class of optimization problems where the objective function is defined over a finite number of variables, while the constraints are defined over an infinite number of variables \citep{Bonnans2013-gt}. The general form of a semi-infinite programming problem is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:semi-infinite-programming}
    \begin{aligned}
        \min_{\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^n} \quad & f(\mathbf x) \\
        \text{s.t.} \quad & g(\mathbf x, \omega) \leq 0, \quad \forall \omega \in \Omega,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $f : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ and $g : \mathbb R^n \times \Omega \to \mathbb R$ are continuous functions, and $\Omega$ is a compact metric space, usually a continuous interval. If $\Omega$ is a finite set, e.g. $\Omega = \{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\}$, \cref{eq:semi-infinite-programming} is reduced to a standard non-linear programming problem, as the feasible set can then be written as $g_i(\cdot) \leq 0, i = 1,\ldots,n$, where $g_i(\cdot) := g(\cdot, \omega_i)$ \citep{Bonnans2013-gt}.

An optimal control problem in its continuous form can be formulated as a semi-infinite programming problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:optimal-control-problem}
    \begin{aligned}
        \min_{\mathbf{x}(\cdot), \mathbf{u}(\cdot)} \quad & \int_{T} J(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t) \, dt \\
        \text{s.t.} \quad & \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf f(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t), \quad \mathbf{x}(t_0) = \mathbf{x}_0, \\
        & \mathbf g(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t) \leq \mathbf 0, \quad \forall t \in T,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $T = [t_0, t_f]$ is the time interval, $\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb R^{n_x}$ is the state, $\mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathbb R^{n_u}$ is the control input, $J : \mathbb R^{n_x} \times \mathbb R^{n_u} \times \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is the cost functional, $\mathbf f : \mathbb R^{n_x} \times \mathbb R^{n_u} \times T \to \mathbb R^{n_x}$ is the state equation, and $\mathbf g : \mathbb R^{n_x} \times \mathbb R^{n_u} \times T \to \mathbb R^{n_g}$ are the algebraic path constraints.

There are two main approaches to solve semi-infinite programming problems: discretization and relaxation. Discretization methods transform the infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one by sampling the infinite set of constraints $\Omega$ at a finite number of points $\omega_i \in \Omega, i = 1, \ldots, N$. The resulting problem can then be solved using standard optimization techniques. Relaxation methods also replace the infinite constraint set with a finite set of constraints, but instead of sampling the infinite set, they introduce auxiliary variables to approximate the infinite-dimensional problem. This is often done by writing $g(\cdot, \omega)$ and $f$ in terms of a finite-dimentional basis, such as B-splines, and then solving the resulting finite-dimensional problem \citep{Dierckx1993}. More details on these methods are given in \cref{sec:multiple-shooting,sec:b-spline-relaxation}.

\subsection{Multiple Shooting}\label{sec:multiple-shooting}
Multiple shooting discretizes the infinite set of constraints by splitting the time interval $T = [t_0,t_f]$ into a finite set of points $\{t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_N\}$. At each shooting node, the state and control are introduced as separate variables. The continuous dynamics are then integrated on each subinterval, typically using Runge-Kutta methods, to ensure continuity between successive nodes.
 
\subsection{B-Spline Relaxation}\label{sec:b-spline-relaxation}

    \item B-spline basis functions
    \item Convex hull property
    \item Conservativeness
    \item Knot insertion
\end{itemize}

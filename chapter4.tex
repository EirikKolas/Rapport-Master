\section{Dynamic Model}
\subsection{Double Integrator}\label{sec:double-integrator}
The double integrator model is a simple model that ensures a continuous position, velocity, and acceleration for the ship. The model is described by the following equations:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:double-integrator}
    \begin{align}
        \dot{\mathbf{p}}(t) &= \mathbf{v}(t), \label{eq:double-integrator-x} \\
        \dot{\mathbf{v}}(t) &= \mathbf{a}(t), \label{eq:double-integrator-v} \\
        \|\mathbf{v}(t)\|_2 &\leq v_{\max}, \label{eq:double-integrator-vmax} \\
        \|\mathbf{a}(t)\|_2 &\leq a_{\max}, \label{eq:double-integrator-a}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathbf{p} = [p_N, p_E]^\top$ denotes the position of the ship, $\mathbf{v} = [v_N, v_E]^\top$ is the velocity, and $\mathbf{a} = [a_N, a_E]^\top$ is the acceleration in North-East coordinates. The $\|\cdot\|_2$ notation denotes the Euclidean norm, and $v_{\max}$ and $a_{\max}$ are the maximum speed and acceleration of the ship, respectively.

This continuous model can be relaxed to a B-spline model by letting $\mathbf{p}(x)$, $\mathbf{v}(x)$, and $\mathbf{a}(x)$ be spline functions on a chosen B-spline basis. It is desirable to let time be a variable in the optimization problem so that minimum time trajectories can be found. It is impractical to let the knot values of the B-spline representation of $\mathbf{p}(x)$ be optimization variables as an analysis of the Cox-de Boor recursion formula in \cref{eq:b-spline-recurrence} shows that the spline function is non-linear in these knot values. More specifically a degree $p$ B-spline with the parameter $x$ fixed, will be a polynomial of degree $p$ in the knot values. Instead, the time variable $t$ is introduced as a function of the parameter $x$, which is a common approach in these types of problems \citep{mercy2017spline,ShortestPathsConvexSets}. 

With this approach, the velocity and acceleration can now be expressed as
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:double-integrator-spline}
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{v}(t) &= \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = \frac{\mathbf{p}'}{t'},
        \label{eq:double-integrator-v-spline} \\
        \mathbf{a}(t) &= \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left(\frac{\mathbf{p}'}{t'}\right) = 
        \frac{
            t'\frac{\partial \mathbf{p}'}{\partial t} - \mathbf{p}'\frac{\partial t'}{\partial t}
            }{(t')^2} = 
        \frac{\mathbf{p}'' - \mathbf{p}'\frac{t''}{t'}}{(t')^2}.
        \label{eq:double-integrator-a-spline}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Here $(\cdot)'$ and $(\cdot)''$ denotes the first and second derivative with respect to the spline parameter $x$, respectively. In \cref{eq:double-integrator-spline}, the inverse function theorem was used to flip the relation between $t$ and $x$. This is only possible if $t$ is a strictly increasing function of $x$, which is the case if the constraint 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:constraint-t}
    t'(x) > 0
\end{equation}
holds.  
If we in addition require the time to be positive, the velocity constraint in \cref{eq:double-integrator-vmax} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:double-integrator-vmax-spline}
    \begin{aligned}
        &&\|\mathbf{v}(t)\|_2 = \left\|\frac{\mathbf{p}'}{t'}\right\|_2 &\leq v_{\max} \\
        &\implies& \|\mathbf{p}'(x)\|_2 &\leq t'(x)v_{\max} \\
        &\implies& \mathbf{p}'(x)\cdot\mathbf{p}'(x) &\leq (t'(x))^2v_{\max}^2.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
To simplify the model, yet another restriction is put on the time function $t(x)$ by requiring it to be a 1st degree B-spline function. This means that the time variable is a piecewise linear function of the parameter $x$, and the second derivative of $t$ is zero, giving the simplified acceleration constraint
\begin{equation}\label{eq:double-integrator-a-spline-simplified}
    \begin{aligned}
        &&\|\mathbf{a}(t)\|_2 = \left\|\frac{\mathbf{p}''}{(t')^2}\right\|_2 &\leq a_{\max} \\
        &\implies& \|\mathbf{p}''(x)\|_2 &\leq t'(x)^2a_{\max} \\
        &\implies& \mathbf{p}''(x)\cdot\mathbf{p}''(x) &\leq t'(x)^4a_{\max}^2.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now the B-Spline relaxation is fully given by the following equations:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete}
    \begin{align}
        \mathbf{p}(x) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} \mathbf{p}_i B_{i,p,\mathbf{t}}(x), \label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-p} \\
        t(x) &= \sum_{i=0}^{m} t_i B_{i,1,\boldsymbol{\tau}}(x), \label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-t} \\
        \mathbf{p}'(x) \cdot \mathbf{p}'(x) &\leq t'(x)^2v_{\max}^2, \label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-vmax} \\
        \mathbf{p}''(x) \cdot \mathbf{p}''(x) &\leq t'(x)^4a_{\max}^2, \label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-a} \\
        t(x) &\geq 0, \label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-t-constraint} \\
        t'(x) &> 0. \label{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-t-derivative} \end{align}
\end{subequations}
The only optimization variables needed are the B-Spline coefficients $\mathbf{p}_i\in\mathbb{R}^2$ and $t_i\in\mathbb{R}^+$ from \cref{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-p,eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-t}, which are subject to the constraints \cref{eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-vmax,eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-a,eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-t-constraint,eq:double-integrator-spline-complete-t-derivative}.


\subsection{Dubins Model}\label{sec:dubins-model}
\todo{Legg til tid på samme måte som i dobbeltintegratormodellen}

The double integrator model is a simple model that ensures a continuous position, velocity, and acceleration for the ship. However, it does not take into account the ship's heading and turning radius. Dubins model (also referred to as the unicycle model) is a more realistic model for ship dynamics, as it describes a vehicle moving in a plane where the velocity points in the direction of the heading. In the motion control literature, there exists a variety of parameterizations for this kind of model. Notably \citet{mercy2017spline}, which uses the tangent half-angle substitution to represent the heading angle in a B-spline framework and \citet{Wang2020}, which uses a convex relaxation technique with sequential convex programming to exchange nonlinear equality constraints with convex inequalities. 

The model in \cite{Wang2020} technique was discarded as the assumtions for the relaxation technique are not valid under a reference following scenario. \cite{mercy2017spline} used the tangent half-angle to parameterize the bicycle model, which also includes the steering angle as a control input. In this work, the simplified Dubins model was tested, but ultimately discarded as the Pythogerean-hodograph (PH) B-spline model has the same properties as the tangent half-angle model, but has in addition all the nice properties described in \cref{sec:pythogerean-hodograph}. See \cref{app:tangent-half-angle} for a more detailed description of the Dubins model and the tangent half-angle substitution.

Dubins model can be described by the following equations:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:dubins-model}
    \begin{align}
        \dot p_N &= V \cos(\chi),       \label{eq:dubins-x} \\
        \dot p_E &= V \sin(\chi),       \label{eq:dubins-y} \\
        \dot \chi &= \omega,          \label{eq:dubins-chi} \\
        |\omega| &\leq \omega_{\max}, \label{eq:dubins-omega} \\
        0 \leq V &\leq V_{\max},      \label{eq:dubins-V} 
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $p_N$ and $p_E$ are the North and East position coordinates of the ship, and $\chi$ is the heading angle. The control input is the speed $V$ and turn rate $\omega$. Using the PH B-spline model from \cref{sec:pythogerean-hodograph}, the Dubins model can be expressed as
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:dubins-model-ph}
    \begin{align}
        \dot p_N(x) &= u(x)^2 - v(x)^2, \label{eq:dubins-ph-x} \\
        \dot p_E(x) &= 2u(x)v(x),       \label{eq:dubins-ph-y} \\
        \dot \chi(x) &= \omega(x) = \frac{2\big(u(x)v'(x) - u'(x)v(x)\big)}{u(x)^2 + v(x)^2},  \label{eq:dubins-ph-chi} \\
        |\omega(x)| &\leq \omega_{\max},  \\
        V(x) &= u(x)^2 + v(x)^2 \\
        0 \leq V(x) &\leq V_{\max}, 
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where \cref{eq:dubins-ph-x,eq:dubins-ph-y} correspond to \cref{eq:hodograph-derivatives-a,eq:hodograph-derivatives-b} and \cref{eq:dubins-ph-chi} follows from \cref{eq:turn-rate}.

To implement this model in an optimization framework, $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are represented as B-spline functions, and the turn-rate constraints are derived as follows
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        |\omega(x)| &\le \omega_{\max} \\
        \implies \left|\frac{2\big(u(x)v'(x) - u'(x)v(x)\big)}{u(x)^2 + v(x)^2}\right| &\le \omega_{\max} \\
        \implies \left|u(x)v'(x) - u'(x)v(x)\right| &\le \frac{\omega_{\max}}{2}\left(u(x)^2 + v(x)^2\right),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
yeilding the polynomial constraints
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:dubins-ph-turn-rate}
    \begin{align}
        u(x)v'(x) - u'(x)v(x) &\le \frac{\omega_{\max}}{2}\left(u(x)^2 + v(x)^2\right), \\
        u(x)v'(x) - u'(x)v(x) &\ge -\frac{\omega_{\max}}{2}\left(u(x)^2 + v(x)^2\right).
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The constraint in \cref{eq:dubins-ph-chi} is a rational B-spline function and could in theory be implemented as a NURBS directly in an optimization framework. However, this is not done as unlike the bilinear terms in \cref{eq:dubins-ph-turn-rate}, the rational term in \cref{eq:dubins-ph-chi} has a singularity when $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are both zero.


\section{Target Ships}
\todo{skriv introduksjon til dette avsnittet}

\subsection{Hyperplane Separation Theorem}
The standard way to enforce collision constraints between the OS and TS is to apply a minumum distance constraint between the two ships as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:minimum-distance}
    (\mathbf p_{\text{OS}} - \mathbf p_{\text{TS}}) \cdot (\mathbf p_{\text{OS}} - \mathbf p_{\text{TS}}) \geq d_{\text{min}}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf p_{\text{OS}}$ and $\mathbf p_{\text{TS}}$ are the positions of the OS and TS, respectively, and $d_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum distance between the two ships. Examples of this type of constraint can be found in \cite{Thyri2022-MPC}.\todo{flere kilder} This constraint is non-convex, as the feasible region for the OS lies outside the circle with radius $d_{\text{min}}$ centered at the TS.

Another method of enforcing collision avoidance is to use the hyperplane separation theorem. Although still non-convex, this method allows for a more flexible formulation of the constraint, as it is not only restricted to circular shapes. 
The hyperplane separation theorem states that for two disjoint convex sets $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$, there exists $\mathbf n\in \mathbb R^n\backslash\{\mathbf0\}$ and $b\in\mathbb R$ such that the hyperplane $H=\{\mathbf x\in\mathbb R^n \mid \mathbf n^\top \mathbf x = b\}$ separates $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ \citep{Boyd2004-ih}. In other words, there exists a function $a^\top x - b$ that is non-negative for all $x \in \mathcal A$ and non-positive for all $x \in \mathcal B$. 

Using this theorem, the collision avoidance task can be transformed to a classification problem. The objective is to find a line that separates the OS and TS, such that the distance between the line and the ships is greater than a given threshold. This is done in the B-spline framework by introducing a hyperplane $\mathcal H$ with normal $\mathbf n(t)\in\mathbb{S}^2_{p,\mathbf t}$ and offset $b(t)\in\mathbb{S}_{p,\mathbf t}$, which separates the OS and TS. This hyperplane is implemented using the following constraints:
\begin{subnumcases}{\label{eq:minimum-distance-hyperplane}\mathcal{H}:}
    \mathbf p_\text{OS}(t) \cdot{\mathbf n}(t) & $\ge b(t) + d_\text{OS}$,
    \label{eq:hyperplane-os} \\
    \mathbf p_\text{TS}(t) \cdot{\mathbf n}(t) & $\le b(t) - d_\text{TS}$,
    \label{eq:hyperplane-ts} \\
    \|{\mathbf n}(t)\|_\infty & $\le 1$.
    \label{eq:hyperplane-norm}
\end{subnumcases}
The constraints in \zcref{eq:hyperplane-os,eq:hyperplane-ts} are enforced by
letting $\mathbf n(t)$ and $b(t)$ be optimization variables. Equation \zcref{eq:hyperplane-norm} is a box constraint on $\mathbf n(t)$, ensuring that the hyperplane normal doesn't become too large. The minimum distance constraint in \cref{eq:minimum-distance} can be equivalently expressed using the hyperplane separation theorem by letting $d_\text{OS} = 0$ and $d_\text{TS} = d_\text{min}$ in \zcref{eq:hyperplane-os,eq:hyperplane-ts}. As the following section shows,

\subsection{Collision Constraints}\label{sec:collision-constraints}

Collision avoidance is non-convex: with fixed start/end points one cannot deform a trajectory from one side of the obstacle to the other without intersection. A convex solver will therefore remain on the same side (see \cref{fig:non-convex-obstacle}), potentially missing the globally optimal path.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/b-spline/non-convex-obstacle.svg}
    \caption{Black dots: fixed start/end points. Dotted line: current trajectory. Solid line: reference. Red circle: obstacle. A convex solver cannot switch sides without violating the obstacle constraint.}
    \label{fig:non-convex-obstacle}
\end{figure}

For designing a COLREGS-compliant trajectory, being able to decide which side of a given target ship to pass on is essential. So to address the aforementioned issue, which side to pass the obstacle on is made a decision variable in a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem as follows:

The idea is that each target ship is represented by two obstacles, each obstacle having only one feasible side to be passed on. The passing side of the target ship is enforced by adding additional points to each obstacle on the opposide side of the passing side using the normal $\mathbf{\hat n}_\text{ref}$ of the reference trajectory $\mathbf p_\text{ref}$. The two obstacles are then moved into and out of the feasible region by introducing a binary variable $z_j\in\{0,1\}$ for each target ship $j$ which controls an offset $M \mathbf{\hat n}_\text{ref}$, where $M$ is a large positive number. More formally, the constraints are given by

\begin{subnumcases}{\label{eq:colregs-bigM}\mathcal{O}_j:}
    \mathbf{n}_{p,j}(t)\cdot\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{OS}}(t)
      & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-os-p}$\ge b_{p,j}(t) + d_{\text{OS}}$\\
    \mathbf{n}_{p,j}(t)\cdot\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{TS},j}(t)
      & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-ts-p}$\le b_{p,j}(t) - d_{\text{TS},j} + M\,z_j$\\
    \mathbf{n}_{p,j}(t)\cdot\bigl(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{TS},j}(t)+2M\,\mathbf{\hat n}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t)\bigr)
      & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-ts-o-p}$\le b_{p,j}(t) - M$\\[1.5ex]
      %
    \mathbf{n}_{s,j}(t)\cdot\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{OS}}(t)
      & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-os-s}$\ge b_{s,j}(t) + d_{\text{OS}}$\\
    \mathbf{n}_{s,j}(t)\cdot\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{TS},j}(t)
      & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-ts-s}$\le b_{s,j}(t) - d_{\text{TS},j} + M\,(1-z_j)$\\
    \mathbf{n}_{s,j}(t)\cdot\bigl(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{TS},j}(t)-2M\,\mathbf{\hat n}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t)\bigr)
      & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-ts-o-s}$\le b_{s,j}(t) - M$\\[1.5ex]
    z_j \in \{0,1\} & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-z} \\
    \|\mathbf{n}_{p,j}(t)\|_\infty\le 1 & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-np} \\
    \|\mathbf{n}_{s,j}(t)\|_\infty\le 1 & \label{eq:colregs-bigM-ns}
\end{subnumcases}
    
Here,
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{n}_{p,j}(t)$ and $b_{p,j}(t)$ are the port‐side hyperplane normal and offset,
    \item $\mathbf{n}_{s,j}(t)$ and $b_{s,j}(t)$ are the starboard‐side normal and offset,
    \item $d_{\text{OS}}$ and $d_{\text{TS},j}$ are the required minimum separations for the OS and TS from the hyperplane, 
    \item $z_j\in\{0,1\}$ selects port‐side ($z_j=0$) or starboard‐side ($z_j=1$) passage,
    \item $\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{TS},j}(t)+2M\,\mathbf{\hat n}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t)$ and $\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{TS},j}(t)-2M\,\mathbf{\hat n}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t)$ are the two obstacles on the opposite side of the passing side,
    \item $M$ is a large constant that renders inactive constraints nonbinding.
    \item and $\mathbf{\hat n}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t)$ is the unit normal of the reference trajectory $\mathbf p_\text{ref}(t)$, defined as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:reference-normal}
        \mathbf{\hat n}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t) = \mathbf R\frac{\mathbf p_\text{ref}'(t)}{\|\mathbf p_\text{ref}'(t)\|_2}.
    \end{equation}
    where $\mathbf R$ is a rotation matrix that rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise around the down axis in a North-East-Down coordinate system.
\end{itemize}
The first three inequalities
(\zcref{eq:colregs-bigM-os-p,eq:colregs-bigM-ts-p,eq:colregs-bigM-ts-o-p})
apply when passing on the port side, while the last three
(\zcref{eq:colregs-bigM-os-s,eq:colregs-bigM-ts-s,eq:colregs-bigM-ts-o-s})
enforce the starboard‐side conditions.


Including all ships’ constraints $\mathcal{O}_j$ guarantees that a passing side is chosen for each TS and that the required separation is maintained.
    
In the NLP relaxation of the MINLP (letting $z_j$ be continuous), there is now a way to continuously move the trajectory from one side of the obstacle to the other without violating any constraints. To be clear, all of the obstacles and points are active at the same time, but with a large enough chosen constant $M$, the inactive obstacles are so far away from the trajectory that they do not affect the optimization problem. This strategy is commonly referred to as the big-M method in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) literature \citep{gan2012adaptive,Cococcioni2020}.

\section{Objective Function}
The goals of the objective function should be 1) to find a safe, COLREGS-compliant trajectory, and 2) to follow a reference trajectory. These objectives are conflicting as rule 8b) of the COLREGS (see \cref{sec:colregs}) states that any alteration of course should be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel. Following a reference trajectory on the other hand often involves the squared error between the vessel and the reference trajectory, which inherently penalizes sudden deviations in course. 
Thus a careful choice of the objective function is important to ensure robust and predictable behaviour. 
The following section will examine the behavior of the B-spline method when applied to a basic reference-following task. The subsequent section will then address COLREGS considerations.


\subsection{Reference Following}
\label{sec:oscillations}
Finding a reference-following trajectory using B-splines can be viewed as a penalized regression problem where the reference trajectory is the data to be fitted and the B-spline is the model used to fit data. In the literature, there are two common ways of fitting a B-Spline to data: 1) O'Sullivan splines \citep{OSullivan1986} or smoothing splines, which balances smoothness and fidelity to the data by penalizing the second derivative of the spline\footnote{More specifically the integral over the square of the second derivative.}, and 2) the P-Spline \citep{Eilers1996}, which penalizes the difference of coefficients directly. The second approach achieves more flexibility, as the penalty function is independent of the degree of the B-spline \citep{Eilers2021}. This section applies these two approaches to a constrained optimal control problem, comparing using the discrete and continuous squared reference error as the cost function. 

% Using the definite integral over the squared reference error as a cost function, gives oscillations in the trajectory. This is due to the fact that the integral is less sensitive to high frequency oscillations than the sum of squared coefficients of the reference error spline. The integral puts more emphasis on the overall global shape of the trajectory, while the sum of squared coefficients puts more emphasis on the local shape. The oscillations can be damped by penalizing acceleration, but this is does not remove the oscillations completely. Further increasing the penalty on acceleration will lead to very slow convergence.
% The oscillations can be removed by using the sum of squared coefficients of the reference error as a cost function.

More concretely, consider the problem of following a reference trajectory, while ensuring that the OS does not exceed a maximum speed:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conservativeness-optimization}
    \begin{aligned}
        \min_{\mathbf c} \quad & J_\text{ref} \\
        \text{subject to} \quad &\mathbf p_\text{os}(0) = \mathbf p_0, \\
                     &\mathbf p_\text{os} = \mathbf B^\top(x) \mathbf c, \\
                     &\mathbf p_\text{ref} = \mathbf B_\text{ref}^\top(x) \mathbf c_\text{ref}, \\
                     &\langle p_\text{os}', p_\text{os}' \rangle \le v_\text{max}^2,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf p_\text{os}$ is the position of the OS and $\mathbf p_\text{ref}$ is the reference position in their respecive B-spline bases $\mathbf B$ and $\mathbf B_\text{ref}$. The objective function $J_\text{ref}$ to be considered has two different formulations, one based on the sum of the squared control points of the reference error and one based on the definite integral over the squared reference error. The two formulations are given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conservativeness-objective}
    J_\text{ref} = \begin{cases}
        \|\text{ctrlPts}(\mathbf p_\text{os} - \mathbf p_\text{ref})\|_\text{F}^2, & \text{discrete cost} \\
        \int_0^1 \left(\mathbf p_\text{os}(x) - \mathbf p_\text{ref}(x)\right)^\top \left(\mathbf p_\text{os}(x) - \mathbf p_\text{ref}(x)\right) dx, & \text{continuous cost}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where the $\text{ctrlPts}(\cdot)$ function extracts the control points $\mathbf c$ of the B-spline function $f(x)=\mathbf B(x)^\top\mathbf c$ and $\|\cdot\|_\text{F}^2$ is the squared Frobenius norm, given by
\begin{equation}
    \|\mathbf A\|_\text{F}^2 = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij}^2,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf A$ is a matrix and $a_{ij}$ is the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $\mathbf A$. All other operations on the B-spline functions are done using the algorithms in \cref{chap:b-spline-theory}. 
This optimization problem is then analyzied for different choices of degree $p$ and number $N$ of uniform B-spline basis functions $\mathbf B$. The resulting trajectories are shown in \cref{fig:conservativeness} with the parameters for the optimization problem set to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conservativeness-parameters}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf p_0 &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
        \mathbf B &= \mathbf B_{p,
            \{
                \{0\}^{(p)}, \{i/N\}_{i=0}^{N}, \{1\}^{(p)}
            \}} \\
        \mathbf B_\text{ref} &= \mathbf B_{1,\{0, 0, 1, 1\}} \\

Both of these objectives consider the total track error (TTE), which is defined as the distance between the OS and the expected position on the time-varying reference trajectory. The TTE is a combination of the cross-track error (XTE) and the along-track error (ATE) \citep{Fossen2011-Handbook}, as shown in \cref{fig:cross-track-along-track-error}. The XTE is the distance between the OS and the reference trajectory, while the ATE is the distance between the OS and the expected position along the path tangent. Defining a cost function that penalizes the XTE is a common approach if the goal is path following rather than trajectory following. It has advantages over the TTE, in that when the OS lags behind the reference trajectory around a corner, the cost in the TTE will make the OS try to cut the corner, which is not necessarily desired behaviour. The XTE cost on the other hand will not penalize this behaviour, as it only considers the closest distance to the reference trajectory. 
With the B-spline framework, however, finding the XTE is not straightforward, and generally involves a search algorithm to find a numerical rather than an algebraic solution \citep{johnson2005distance,hu2005second,chen2009computing}. The TTE is therefore used as the cost function in this work, as it is the more straightforward approach. The rest of this section serves to analyze the cost functions in \cref{eq:conservativeness-objective}.

\end{figure}


From \cref{fig:conservativeness-traj} two things are immediately clear: 1) 
the continuous cost function gives oscillations in the trajectory, 
and 2) 
for a low $N$, the trajectory using the discrete cost function is much more conservative than the trajectory using the continuous cost function. The first observation will now be analyzed in more detail. 

There are multiple ways to interpret the oscillations in the continuous cost function case. Qualitatively, the oscillations are a result of the fact that the integral is less sensitive to high frequency oscillations than the sum of squared coefficients of the reference error spline. The integral over the dot product puts more emphasis on the overall global shape of the trajectory, while the sum of squared coefficients puts more emphasis on the local shape. The oscillations can also be attributed to the definition of the B-spline dot product, which naturaly introduces cross-terms between the B-spline coefficients through the Kronecker product in \cref{alg:multiplication}. This is opposed to the purely square terms in the sum of squared coefficients objective.

The oscillations can be damped by penalizing acceleration, but this is does not remove the oscillations completely, as can be seen in \cref{fig:conservativeness-oscillation-damping}. Here the continuous cost function is used with a penalty $P$ on the second order difference of the optimization coefficients $\mathbf c$ of the B-spline function. The penalty is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conservativeness-oscillation-damping}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf c &= [\mathbf c_i]_{i=0}^{N-1} =
        \text{ctrlPts}\left(\mathbf{p}_\text{os}\right), \\
        \Delta \mathbf c &= [\Delta\mathbf c_i]_{i=0}^{N-2} =
        [\mathbf c_i - \mathbf c_{i-1}]_{i=1}^{N-1}, \\
        \Delta^2 \mathbf c &= [\Delta \mathbf c_i - \Delta \mathbf c_{i-1}]_{i=1}^{N-2}, \\
        P &= \lambda \|\Delta^2 \mathbf c\|_\text{F}^2,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a parameter that controls the strength of the penalty. This is analogous to the P-spline construction \citep{Eilers1996} as the penalty is applied directly to the coefficients of the B-spline function. For small penalties e.g. $\lambda=0.01$, the trajectory approaches that of \cref{fig:conservativeness-traj-integral}. Increasing the penalty to $\lambda=100$ gives a trajectory that only reaches about half the distance to the end of the reference. For no $\lambda$ in between does the trajectory not overshoot the North = 0m axis. As neither oscillations nor overshooting is desirable behaviour, using the integral over the squared reference error as a cost function is not a good choice. Adding the penalty term still leads to overshooting the reference. These two methods are therefore not suitible for the final implementation. The discrete cost function on the other hand, has none of these issues and will be further analyzed in the remainder of this section.

\end{figure}


Reviewing the results in \cref{fig:conservativeness-traj}, it is clear that the discrete cost function is much more conservative than the continuous cost function for low $N$. As $N$ increases, the trajectory using the discrete cost function approaches that of the continuous cost function. This can be seen more clearly in \cref{fig:conservativeness}, where the integral of the square error is plotted against the number $N$ of B-spline basis functions up to $N=40$ for both cost functions. For these values of $N$, the plot shows an exponential convergence to the same value, with the degree of the B-spline basis functions $p$ having a small effect on the convergence.

\FloatBarrier
To summarize, the discrete cost function is the best choice for the final implementation. The continuous cost function gives oscillations in the trajectory and is not able to follow the reference trajectory, even with a penalty on the second order difference of the optimization coefficients. The discrete cost function on the other hand, is able to follow the reference trajectory and does not give oscillations in the trajectory. As a drawback, the discrete cost function is more conservative than the continuous cost function for low $N$. Higher $N$, yeild diminishing returns in closing the optimality gap as the knot insertion becomes increasingly local as more knots are added.

\subsection{COLREGS Objectives}\label{sec:colregs-objectives}
Rule 8b) of the COLREGS states that any alteration of course should be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel. This is impractical in an optimization context as penalizing low turn rates while keeping the cost on high and no turn rates low leads to a non-convex cost. See \cref{fig:turn-rate-cost} for an illustration of the problem. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig/illustrations/Turn rate cost.svg}
    \caption{Imagined Turn rate cost for a vessel following Rule 8b) of the COLREGS.}
    \label{fig:turn-rate-cost}
\end{figure}

\cite{Thyri2022-MPC} proposes a solution to improve the compliance of rule 8 by introducing a time window where the cost for altering course is lowered. The goal of this is to control when the OS should alter course, and with manipulation of the length and position of the time window, the cost function can facilitate a more COLREGS compliant trajectory. This idea is adapted to the B-spline MINMPC framework as follows:
An encounter window $W_\text e$ is defined, during which the OS should ensure safe passage. Within $W_\text e$, the cost for reference trajectory following is reduced, while the cost for altering course remains high, except at the start and end of $W_\text e$, denoted as maneuver windows $W_\text{mv}$. 
The reason for the second maneuver window as opposed to the singular one in \cite{Thyri2022-MPC} is to facilitate a clear maneuver back to the reference trajectory after the encounter window.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/illustrations/Maneuver window.svg}
    \caption{Weights for turn rate and TTE plotted against time.}
    \label{fig:maneuver-window}
\end{figure}

The encounter window and maneuver windows enter the cost function as weights $w_\text e(x)$ and $w_\text{mv}(x)$, respectively on the reference trajectory following cost and the cost for altering course. The weights enter the cost function $O$ as
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:cost-maneuver-window}
    \begin{align}
        J_\text{mv} &= \|\text{ctrlPts}\big(w_\text{mv}(x)(\mathbf p'_\text{os}(x) - \mathbf p'_\text{ref}(x))\big)\|_\text{F}^2, \label{eq:cost-maneuver-window-mv}\\
        J_\text{ref} &= \|\text{ctrlPts}\big(w_\text e(x)(\mathbf p_\text{os}(x) - \mathbf p_\text{ref}(x))\big)\|_\text{F}^2, \label{eq:cost-maneuver-window-ref}\\
        J &= J_\text{ref} + J_\text{mv}, \label{eq:cost-maneuver-window-total}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $J_\text{mv}$ is the cost for altering course, $w_\text e(x)$ is the weight for the reference trajectory following cost, and $w_\text{mv}(x)$ is the weight for the maneuver window cost as shown in \cref{fig:maneuver-window}. Notice that $J_\text{mv}$ is defined using the Frobenius norm over the control points of the B-spline function as opposed to the definite integral over the squared reference error for the same reason as in \cref{sec:oscillations}.

The advantage of the B-spline framework in this case is that the weights can be defined as B-spline functions themselves. This allows for great flexibility in shaping the desired encounter trajectory. The function shape shown in \cref{fig:maneuver-window}, can be represented using a zero-degree B-spline. If smoother transitions are desired, higher degree B-splines can be used.
If the weights are fixed as a function of time before the optimization problem is solved, then the costs are constant with respect to the optimization variables and the optimization problem is convex as opposed to that of \cref{fig:turn-rate-cost}.

Estimating when the encounter window should start and end is a non-trivial problem. As is determining how long the maneuver windows should be. \cite{Thyri2022-MPC} proposes to use the time of closest point of approach (TCPA) to the TS along the desired trajectory. The desired trajectory can for example be estimated using Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance \citep{Fossen2011-Handbook} or by considering the optimzation problem without the TS. Estimation of the encounter window time is implemented according to \cite{Thyri2022-MPC}, and won't be discussed further here.


\section{Implementation}\label{sec:python-implementation}

The B-spline MINMPC is implemented in python using CasADi \citep{casadi} and numpy \citep{numpy} as the main libraries. The code is divided into two main parts: a B-spline implementation and a CasAdi wrapper. 
The B-spline implementation closely follows the structure in \citet{mercy2016spline}, and takes inspiration from the CasAdi wrapper presented there. The main modifications are focused around on small optimizations, making the library more type safe, and making it easier to use with vector-valued spline functions. Support for CasADi's MIP solvers was also added, which was not present in the original implementation. 
The code is available in \todo{gh repo}.

In the end, all the B-spline transformations and handling is abstracted away, letting the user create B-spline variables and constraints on symbolic variables as if they were normal CasADi variables. 

\subsection{Optimization Problem Class}
This section will present the public interface of the Optimization Problem class. The class is designed to be used with CasADi and operates similarly to CasADi's own Opti framework. It differs from CasADi's Opti framework in that it supports B-spline variables and constraints, as well as binary and integer variables more seamlessly. The Optimization Problem class is also modular, in the sense that different objects can be used to represent e.g. the own ship, target ship and reference, before being combined into a single optimization problem. This will be clarified in the following example.

\begin{example}{Optimization Problem Setup}
\begin{python}
from cs_mpc import OptiObject, OptiCollection, BSplineBasis


degree = 3
n_control_points = 10
basis = create_uniform_b_spline_basis(
    degree, n_control_points, 0, 1
)

own_ship = OptiObject('own_ship')
os_pos = own_ship.declare_spline_variable('pos', n_dim=2, basis=basis)
os_pos_0 = own_ship.declare_parameter('pos_0', n_dim=2)
os_pos_f = own_ship.declare_parameter('pos_f', n_dim=2)

own_ship.declare_constraint(os_pos(0) - os_pos_0, lb=0, ub=0)
own_ship.declare_constraint(os_pos(1) - os_pos_f, lb=0, ub=0)

end_err = os_pos - os_pos_f
own_ship.declare_objective(end_err.dot(end_err).definite_integral(0,1))


target_ship = OptiObject('target_ship')
ts_pos = target_ship.declare_spline_parameter('pos', n_dim=2, basis=basis)
ts_err = os_pos - ts_pos
min_dist = target_ship.declare_parameter('min_dist', n_dim=1)
target_ship.declare_constraint(ts_err.dot(ts_err) - min_dist**2, lb=0)


opti = OptiCollection([own_ship, target_ship])
own_ship.set_value('pos_0', [0, 0])
own_ship.set_value('pos_f', [1000, 0])
target_ship.set_value('pos', ...)
target_ship.set_value('min_dist', 10)
sol = opti.solve()

\end{python}
\end{example}


\section{Summary}

The complete B-spline MINMPC problem can be written compactly as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:minmpc-compact}
    \begin{aligned}
        \min
        \quad & J_\text{ref}(\mathbf{p}_\text{OS}) + J_\text{mv}(\mathbf{p}_\text{OS}) + w_\text{time}\,t(1)
        \\
        \text{subject to}\quad
        & \mathcal{D}_{DI}(\mathbf{p}_\text{OS})
        \text{ or }
        \mathcal{D}_{PH}(\mathbf{p}_\text{OS}),
        \\
        & \mathcal{O}_j\bigl(
            \mathbf{n}_{p,j}, \mathbf{n}_{s,j}, b_{p,j}, b_{s,j}, z_j
        \bigr),
        \quad &\forall j&\in \{1,\ldots,N_\text{TS}\},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In this formulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $J_{\mathrm{mw}}$ penalizes maneuvers outside the desired time window via weights $w_k$ on derivative norms (\cref{eq:cost-maneuver-window-mv}).
    \item $J_{\mathrm{ref}}$ penalizes deviation from the reference trajectory via the squared Frobenius norm of the B-spline coefficients (\cref{eq:cost-maneuver-window-ref}).
    \item $\mathcal{D}_{DI}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{PH}$ denote the double‐integrator and PH‐spline Dubins model constraints, respectively.
    \item $\mathcal{O}_j$ is the Big-M collision‐avoidance constraint set from \eqref{eq:colregs-bigM} for each target ship $j$ in the encounter.
    \item $w_\text{time}$ is a weight on the final time of the variable $t(x)$, which is a B-spline variable representing the time of the OS.
\end{itemize}
The optimization variables are the B-spline coefficients of the spline functions
$\mathbf{p}_\text{OS}(t)$, $t(x)$, $\mathbf{n}_{p,j}(x)$, $\mathbf{n}_{s,j}(x)$, $b_{p,j}(x)$, $b_{s,j}(x)$ defined over a suitable knot vector $\mathbf{t}\in[0,1]$, and the binary variables $z_j$.
